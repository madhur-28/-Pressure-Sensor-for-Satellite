# -Pressure-Sensor-for-Satellite

In domain of Aerospace, I completed project focused on the development of a Pressure Sensor for the prestigious GAGANYAAN Satellite. My role encompasses not only the creation of the sensor but also active involvement in Semiconductor Device Characterization, Data Analysis, and Process Control Automation of Chips. Leveraging my expertise in LabVIEW, I've played a pivotal role in ensuring the seamless functionality and reliability of the developed pressure sensor.
